## RANS_Channel

The source codes available here are based on the [publication:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142727X18301978)
[![paper](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/RANS_Channel/blob/master/paper.png)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142727X18301978)

The codes solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equaitons for a fully developed turbulent channel flow with varying properties, such as density and viscosity. The code demonstrates how to modify existing turbulence models to properly account these thermophysical property variations. Five models are used for demonstration:
* an algebraic eddy viscosity model (Cess, 1958),
* the Spalart and Allmaras model (1994),
* k-epsilon model based on Myong and Kasagi (1993),
* Menter's SST k-omega model (Menter, 1995)
* V2F model (medic and Durbin, 2012). 

They are available as
* matlab (matlab/main.m) and
* python source in form of a jupyter notebook: [main.ipynb](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/RANS_Channel/blob/master/main.ipynb) or using the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/RANS_Channel/blob/master/main.ipynb)

## Requirements

* matlab
* Jupyter Notebook, python3.5 


## Execution

Either run the matlab file main.m, or execute the jupyter notebook. The codes run cases for which DNS data is available to compare with. The DNS data is given in the directory [DNS_data](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/RANS_Channel/tree/master/DNS_data), which are based on this [publication](http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/22297028/PecnikPatel.pdf).
